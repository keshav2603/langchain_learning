       "'### Short Summary\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily comprised of three types of layers: **convolutional layers**, **pooling layers**, and **fully-connected layers**. These layers are stacked to form an architecture that transforms input image pixels into class scores for classification or regression.\\n\\n### Detailed Explanation\\nAccording to the provided text, the architecture of a CNN is built by stacking specific types of layers, each serving a distinct purpose:\\n\\n*   **Input Layer:** This layer holds the raw pixel values of the image.\\n*   **Convolutional Layer:** This layer calculates the scalar product between the weights of neurons and the local regions of the input they are connected to. It determines the output of neurons and is often followed by an \"elementwise\" activation function, such as **ReLu** or **sigmoid**, to produce activations for the next layer.\\n*   **Pooling Layer:** This layer is responsible for downsampling along the spatial dimensionality of the input. This process reduces the number of parameters within the activation.\\n*   **Fully-Connected Layer:** These layers function similarly to those in traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). They take the activations and attempt to produce class scores used for classification. It is suggested that ReLu be used between these layers to enhance performance.\\n\\nThe text notes that while there is no single set way to formulate an architecture, a common pattern involves stacking convolutional layers (sometimes two at a time) followed by pooling layers in a repeated manner before feeding the data into fully-connected layers.\\n\\n### Key Points\\n*   **Three Primary Layer Types:** Convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected.\\n*   **Input Handling:** The input layer stores pixel values.\\n*   **Feature Selection:** Stacking multiple convolutional layers allows the network to select more complex features.\\n*   **Complexity Reduction:** Splitting large convolutional layers into smaller ones (e.g., using a 3x3 receptive field) is advised to reduce computational complexity.\\n*   **Downsampling:** Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensionality and parameter counts.\\n*   **Output:** The final fully-connected layers produce the class scores, and the last layer contains associated loss functions.\\n\\n### Citations\\n*   [Document(id=\\'9bfe65db-f57c-4bf7-9dbc-ab3a6952b3be\\')]\\n*   [Document(id=\\'39f98fe3-6dd3-44ad-b154-9722d2761867\\')]\\n*   [Document(id=\\'af246569-0044-4ac1-bdd9-0945d898162b\\')]\\n*   [Document(id=\\'5da9d2e5-6a53-4495-83b0-bea00d34e083\\')]\\n*   [Document(id=\\'683bf19e-072b-4094-baf7-0a1810735d38\\')]'"
