       "\"### 1. Short Summary\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily composed of three types of layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully-connected layers. These layers are stacked in various configurations to transform input data (such as pixel values) into class scores for classification or regression.\\n\\n### 2. Detailed Explanation\\nThe architecture of a CNN is formed by stacking specific functional layers:\\n\\n*   **Convolutional Layers:** These layers determine the output of neurons connected to local regions of the input. This is achieved by calculating the scalar product between the neurons' weights and the specific region of the input volume. It is often recommended to stack multiple convolutional layers to select more complex features or to split large layers into smaller ones to reduce computational complexity.\\n*   **Pooling Layers:** These layers perform downsampling along the spatial dimensionality of the input. This process reduces the number of parameters within the activations, effectively shrinking the volume of data.\\n*   **Fully-Connected Layers:** Similar to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), these layers are connected to the activations of previous layers to produce final class scores. They are typically placed at the end of the architecture to facilitate classification.\\n\\nAdditionally, activation functions such as **ReLu** (Rectified Linear Unit) or **sigmoid** are applied to the outputs of these layers to transform the data. The final layer of the network typically contains loss functions associated with the target classes.\\n\\n### 3. Key Points\\n*   **Three Main Layer Types:** Convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected.\\n*   **Convolutional Function:** Uses scalar products and local region connectivity to extract features.\\n*   **Pooling Function:** Reduces spatial dimensionality and parameter count through downsampling.\\n*   **Fully-Connected Function:** Generates class scores for classification, operating similarly to standard ANNs.\\n*   **Activation Functions:** ReLu is frequently used between layers (convolutional and fully-connected) to improve performance.\\n*   **Architecture Strategy:** Common practices include stacking multiple convolutional layers before a pooling layer to capture complex features.\\n\\n### 4.
