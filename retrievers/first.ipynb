Model Functionality focuses on textual descriptions, visualization, and local explanations, which clarify specific outputs or instances rather than entire models. All these concepts aim to enhance the comprehensibility and usability of AI systems.\\nIf algorithms fulfill these principles, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking them and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.\\nSometimes it is also possible to achieve a high-accuracy result with white-box ML algorithms.

But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained, its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures. The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios. The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more. ELIZA\\'s key method of operation involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of the corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word \\'MOTHER\\' with \\'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY\\'). Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as \"intelligent\".\\nFollowing ELIZA, psychiatrist Kenneth Colby developed PARRY in 1972.\\nFrom 1978 to some time after 1983, the CYRUS project led by Janet Kolodner constructed a chatbot simulating Cyrus Vance (57th United States Secretary of State).
