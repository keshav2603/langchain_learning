On a pitch of dust and broken dreams,
Two creases hold a nation’s schemes.
The sun stands still, the crowd holds tight,
As leather waits to test the night.

The bowler runs, a measured rage,
Years of grind in every pace.
The ball swings late, it talks, it bites,
A whispered threat in fading light.

The batter waits—calm, still, precise,
Eyes that read the roll of dice.
One heartbeat more, the bat comes through,
A clean sound splits the sky in two.

A cover drive, a work of art,
Elegance born from a fearless heart.
The fielders chase, the boundary sings,
Four runs carried on roaring wings.

But cricket’s more than runs and score,
It’s patience tested, spirit sore.
A dropped catch, a stubborn stand,
Sweat and hope go hand in hand.

Rain may fall, the light may fade,
Umpire’s call, a risky trade.
Still the game goes on its way,
Teaching life in every play.

For in this field of green and brown,
Heroes rise and egos drown.
Between bat and breath we learn to see—
Cricket is time, and time is free.
